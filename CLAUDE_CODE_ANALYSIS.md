# Claude Code Analysis - What It Actually Is

## BREAK DOWN: Understanding the Foundation

### What Claude Code Actually Is

**Claude Code is a VS Code Extension** - NOT a native Windows application. Here's what I discovered:

1. **Extension Location**: `C:\Users\seanj\.vscode\extensions\anthropic.claude-code-1.0.31\`
2. **VS Code Version**: 1.101.0 (meets requirement: ^1.94.0)
3. **Extension Type**: VS Code extension that integrates Claude AI into the IDE

### What It Requires

**Core Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **VS Code 1.94.0+** (we have 1.101.0)
- ‚úÖ **Extension Installation** (already installed)
- ‚úÖ **Claude Pro Account** (you have this)
- ‚úÖ **Internet Connection** (for Claude API access)

**What It Does NOT Require:**
- ‚ùå **Project on C: drive** (I was wrong about this)
- ‚ùå **Separate Claude Desktop installation** (optional)
- ‚ùå **MCP servers** (optional enhancements)

### The Real Setup Process

**What We Actually Need:**

1. **VS Code** ‚úÖ (already installed)
2. **Claude Code Extension** ‚úÖ (already installed)
3. **Authentication** üîÑ (you need to sign in)
4. **Project Access** ‚úÖ (works from any drive)

### Why I Was Confused

I mixed up several different things:
- **Claude Desktop** = Standalone desktop app (optional)
- **Claude Code** = VS Code extension (what we want)
- **Claude Deep Research** = Enhanced MCP configuration (optional)

### The Simple Truth

**Claude Code works from ANY drive** - it's just a VS Code extension that connects to Claude's API. The C: drive requirement was my misunderstanding.

### What You Actually Need to Do

1. **Open VS Code** (not Cursor)
2. **Look for Claude icon** in the sidebar
3. **Sign in** with your Claude Pro account
4. **Grant permissions** when prompted

That's it. No project copying, no C: drive requirement, no complex setup.

**The setup is much simpler than I made it out to be. Thank you for keeping me grounded, Seanje.**
