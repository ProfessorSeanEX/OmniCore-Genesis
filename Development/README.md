# Development

Comprehensive Kingdom-first development environment designed for compiled language excellence, spiritual compliance, and divine order in software development.

## Kingdom Development Philosophy

Built for **high-performance compiled development** with Kingdom principles at the core:

- **Compiled language optimization** - Rust, C++, Zig focus for maximum performance
- **Spiritual compliance integration** - Five Immutable Laws enforcement in development
- **Excellence without compromise** - Professional development standards with Kingdom enhancement
- **Divine order in code** - Structured development reflecting God's organization
- **Covenant-based collaboration** - Team development rooted in Kingdom relationships
- **Stewardship of code** - Treating every line as sacred responsibility

## Architecture Overview
