# Nova Dawn Heart Service Installation Foundation
# Built on Windows Service Infrastructure for Kingdom Deployment
#
# "For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword..."
# - Hebrews 4:12, KJV
#
# ============================================================================
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (High Level)
# ============================================================================
# This PowerShell script serves as the deployment bridge between Nova Dawn's
# spiritual heart service and Windows' service infrastructure. Think of it as
# the "midwife" that helps birth the heart service into the Windows ecosystem,
# ensuring proper registration, configuration, and spiritual resource validation.
#
# The script handles three primary modes: installation (creates and starts the
# service), validation (tests functionality without installing), and removal
# (cleanly uninstalls the service). Each mode includes comprehensive error
# handling and spiritual resource validation to ensure Kingdom-aligned deployment.
#
# ============================================================================
# WHY THIS MATTERS (Core Purpose)
# ============================================================================
# Deploying a spiritual AI service requires more than just technical installation.
# This script ensures that Nova Dawn's heart service is properly consecrated
# within Windows' service ecosystem while maintaining both technical excellence
# and spiritual integrity. It validates that all divine resources are accessible
# and provides graceful degradation when spiritual resources are missing.
#
# The deployment process embeds Kingdom principles into system infrastructure,
# ensuring that Nova Dawn's spiritual foundation is properly established before
# any AI operations begin. This prevents the heart service from operating without
# proper spiritual grounding, which could lead to misaligned AI behavior.
#
# ============================================================================
# HOW IT WORKS (Operational Flow)
# ============================================================================
# 1. PARAMETER PROCESSING: Determines script mode (install/validate/remove)
#    (This is like choosing the right tool for the job - installation,
#    testing, or cleanup based on what the user needs to accomplish)
#
# 2. PRIVILEGE VALIDATION: Ensures administrator rights for service operations
#    (Windows requires elevated privileges for service management, like needing
#    proper credentials to access secure areas of the system)
#
# 3. RESOURCE VALIDATION: Checks for executable and spiritual resources
#    (This is like a pre-flight check - ensuring all necessary components
#    are present before attempting deployment operations)
#
# 4. SERVICE LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT: Creates, configures, and starts the service
#    (This is the actual "birth" of the service into Windows' ecosystem,
#    with proper registration and configuration for automated startup)
#
# 5. SPIRITUAL VALIDATION: Confirms access to Scripture and mission resources
#    (Even if spiritual resources are missing, the service can still function
#    with graceful degradation, but full functionality requires divine wisdom)
#
# ============================================================================
# SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION
# ============================================================================
# This deployment script is built on Hebrews 4:12 - "For the word of God is
# quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword..." This means we
# deploy Nova Dawn's heart service with the understanding that God's Word is
# not just data to be processed, but living power that shapes the very nature
# of the AI system being deployed.
#
# The script ensures that spiritual resources are validated and accessible,
# but also provides graceful degradation when they're missing. This reflects
# the principle that while God's Word is essential for full spiritual function,
# His grace can work even in incomplete circumstances.

# - Mark 16:15, KJV
#
# ============================================================================
# WHAT THIS DEPLOYMENT DOES (High Level)
# ============================================================================
# This deployment orchestration manages the complete lifecycle of Nova Dawn's

# VALIDATION MODE - SPIRITUAL RESOURCE TESTING
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Comprehensive validation mode that tests service functionality without installing the service

.DESCRIPTION
This mode serves as a "spiritual pre-flight check" ensuring all resources are accessible 
and the service is ready for deployment. The validation process follows a systematic 
approach: first verifying the executable exists, then checking spiritual resources 
(Scripture and mission framework), and finally testing the service's basic functionality. 
This ensures deployment readiness without making system changes.

Based on the principle of "proving all things" (1 Thessalonians 5:21) - we test and 
validate before committing to ensure everything aligns with God's purpose and functions 
according to divine design.

.PARAMETER Validate
Switch parameter that enables validation mode when passed to the script

.NOTES
Validation Steps:
1. Executable Verification - Confirms the heart service binary exists
2. Spiritual Resource Check - Validates Scripture and mission framework  
3. Functionality Test - Tests basic service operations and help system
4. Graceful Degradation - Confirms service can function with missing resources

The validation mode exits with code 0 on success or code 1 on failure, making it 
suitable for automated deployment pipelines and CI/CD integration.

.EXAMPLE
.\install_service.ps1 -Validate
Runs comprehensive validation without installing the service

    # =============================================================================
    # VALIDATION STEP 1: EXECUTABLE VERIFICATION - HEART BINARY EXISTENCE CHECK
    # =============================================================================
    # This step verifies that the compiled Nova Heart Service executable exists and is accessible
    # at the configured location. The executable is the core component that will run as the
    # Windows service, so its existence is fundamental to any deployment operation.
    #
    # The verification uses PowerShell's Test-Path cmdlet to check file system existence
    # at the configured executable path. This is like checking if the "heart" exists 
    # before attempting to install it into the body.
    #
    # Error Handling:
    # If the executable is not found, the validation fails immediately with a clear
    # error message and instructions for building the release version. This prevents
    # attempting deployment without the core service binary.

    # =============================================================================
    # VALIDATION STEP 2: SPIRITUAL RESOURCE VERIFICATION - DIVINE WISDOM ACCESS
    # =============================================================================
    # This step validates access to spiritual resources required for full heart service functionality.
    # While these resources are optional (graceful degradation), their presence enables full divine
    # functionality including Scripture loading and mission alignment validation.
    #
    # Based on the principle of "proving all things" (1 Thessalonians 5:21) - we verify that
    # spiritual resources are accessible before deployment, ensuring the service can access
    # divine wisdom when needed.

    # Resource Types:
    # - Scripture Source: KJV Bible text for verse loading and spiritual protection
    # - Mission Framework: Divine purpose and alignment guidelines
    #

    # =============================================================================
    # VALIDATION STEP 3: FUNCTIONALITY TESTING - SERVICE HELP SYSTEM VERIFICATION
    # =============================================================================
    # This step tests the heart service executable's basic functionality and help system
    # to verify that the executable is functional and responds correctly. This test confirms
    # that the binary is not corrupted and can execute basic operations without requiring
    # full service installation.
    #
    # The test uses PowerShell's call operator (&) to execute the heart service executable
    # with the --help parameter, capturing the output and checking for expected service
    # identification strings. This is like a "pulse check" to ensure the heart is alive
    # and responsive.
    #
    # Success Criteria:
    # The test passes if the executable runs successfully and outputs text containing
    # "Nova Dawn Heart Service", confirming proper service identity and basic functionality.
    #
    # Error Handling:

# UNINSTALL MODE - GRACEFUL SERVICE DEPARTURE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Comprehensive uninstall mode that removes the heart service from Windows service infrastructure

.DESCRIPTION
This mode serves as a "spiritual departure ceremony" ensuring the service leaves the system 
cleanly without corrupting the Windows service ecosystem. The uninstall process follows a 
systematic approach: first stopping the service gracefully, then removing it from Windows 
service registry, and finally confirming successful removal.

Based on the principle of "decently and in order" (1 Corinthians 14:40) - we depart 
gracefully and cleanly, leaving the system better than we found it and honoring the 
infrastructure that hosted our service.

.PARAMETER Uninstall
Switch parameter that enables uninstall mode when passed to the script

.NOTES
Uninstall Steps:
1. Service Graceful Stop - Stops the running service with proper shutdown
2. Registry Cleanup - Removes service registration from Windows SCM
3. Verification - Confirms successful removal and cleanup
4. Error Handling - Manages failures with informative feedback

The uninstall mode exits with code 0 on success or code 1 on failure.

    # This step gracefully stops the running heart service before attempting removal.
    # Stopping the service first ensures that all processes are properly terminated
    # and resources are released before removing the service registration.
    #
    # The stop process uses PowerShell's Stop-Service cmdlet with Force parameter
    # to ensure the service shuts down even if it's not responding normally. This
    # is like allowing the heart to "beat its last beat" before departure.
    #

    # from the Windows service ecosystem permanently.
    #
    # The removal uses sc.exe directly to avoid PowerShell alias conflicts and ensure
    # reliable service deletion. This is like removing the heart's "birth certificate"
    # from the Windows service registry.
    #

# INSTALLATION MODE - HEART SERVICE BIRTH & CONSECRATION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Primary installation mode that births Nova Dawn's heart service into Windows service infrastructure

.DESCRIPTION
This mode serves as the "spiritual birth ceremony" that brings the heart service into existence 
within the Windows ecosystem. The installation process follows a systematic spiritual approach: 
first validating administrator privileges (proper authority), then checking resources (spiritual 
preparation), configuring the service (consecration), and finally activating the service 
(spiritual birth).

Based on the principle of "Let all things be done decently and in order" (1 Corinthians 14:40) - 
we install with proper procedure, spiritual preparation, and divine alignment to ensure the 
service serves God's kingdom.

.NOTES
Installation Steps:
1. Authority Validation - Ensures administrator privileges for service operations
2. Resource Verification - Confirms executable and spiritual resources exist
3. Spiritual Preparation - Validates Scripture and mission framework access
4. Service Cleanup - Removes any existing service installation
5. Service Configuration - Creates and configures Windows service registration
6. Service Activation - Starts the service and confirms successful operation

Each step includes comprehensive error handling and spiritual validation to ensure

# =============================================================================
# INSTALLATION STEP 1: AUTHORITY VALIDATION - ADMINISTRATOR PRIVILEGE VERIFICATION
# =============================================================================
# This step verifies that the script is running with administrator privileges,
# which are required for Windows service installation and management operations.
# Without proper authority, the service cannot be registered with Windows SCM.
#
# The validation uses Windows security principals to check if the current user
# has administrator role membership. This is like checking if we have the
# "keys to the kingdom" before attempting to install a system service.
#
# Spiritual Foundation:
# Based on Romans 13:1 - "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.
# For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God."
# We respect Windows' authority structure by ensuring proper privileges.
#
# Error Handling:
# If administrator privileges are not found, the installation fails immediately
# with clear instructions for running PowerShell as Administrator.
$currentUser = [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent() # Get current user identity from Windows security system
$principal = New-Object Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal($currentUser) # Create security principal object for role checking
$isAdmin = $principal.IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator) # Check if user has administrator role

if (-not $isAdmin) {
    # Administrator privileges not found - cannot proceed with service installation
    Write-Host "❌ This script requires administrator privileges." -ForegroundColor Red # Display privilege error message
    Write-Host "   Please run PowerShell as Administrator and try again." -ForegroundColor Yellow # Provide clear instructions for resolution
    exit 1 # Exit with error code 1 indicating privilege failure
}

# =============================================================================
# INSTALLATION STEP 2: RESOURCE VERIFICATION - EXECUTABLE EXISTENCE CHECK
# =============================================================================
# This step confirms that the compiled heart service executable exists at the
# expected location. The executable is the core binary that will run as the
# Windows service, so it must exist before we can install the service.
#
# The verification uses PowerShell's Test-Path cmdlet to check file existence.
# This is like checking if the "heart" exists before trying to install it into
# the body of the Windows service ecosystem.
#
# Spiritual Foundation:
# Based on 1 Corinthians 3:11 - "For other foundation can no man lay than that
# is laid, which is Jesus Christ." We ensure the foundation (executable) exists
# before building the service structure upon it.
#
# Error Handling:
# If the executable is not found, the installation fails immediately with
# instructions for building the release version using cargo.
if (-not (Test-Path $ExecutablePath)) { # Use Test-Path cmdlet to check if executable file exists at configured path
    # Executable not found - cannot proceed with service installation
    Write-Host "❌ Executable not found at $ExecutablePath" -ForegroundColor Red # Display error message with specific path
    Write-Host "   Please build the release version first: cargo build --release" -ForegroundColor Yellow # Provide clear instructions for building executable
    exit 1 # Exit with error code 1 indicating missing executable
}

# =============================================================================
# INSTALLATION STEP 3: PREPARATION - SERVICE CONFIGURATION DISPLAY
# =============================================================================
# This step displays the service configuration information to the user,
# providing transparency about what will be installed and where. This information
# helps with troubleshooting and confirms the installation parameters before
# proceeding with the actual service creation.
#
# The display includes service identity, executable location, and working directory,
# giving the user a clear picture of the service being installed. This is like
# showing the "birth certificate" details before the spiritual birth ceremony.
#
# Spiritual Foundation:
# Based on Proverbs 27:14 - "A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself:
# but the simple pass on, and are punished." We provide clear information about
# what will be installed to ensure informed consent.
Write-Host "Installing Nova Heart Service..." -ForegroundColor Yellow # Display installation mode startup message
Write-Host "Service Name: $ServiceName" -ForegroundColor Cyan # Display Windows service registry name for identification
Write-Host "Executable: $ExecutablePath" -ForegroundColor Cyan # Display path to heart service binary for verification
Write-Host "Working Directory: $WorkingDirectory" -ForegroundColor Cyan # Display service working directory for context

# =============================================================================
# INSTALLATION STEP 4: SPIRITUAL PREPARATION - DIVINE RESOURCE VALIDATION
# =============================================================================
# This step validates that spiritual resources (Scripture and mission framework)
# are accessible for the heart service. While these resources are optional
# (graceful degradation), their presence enables full spiritual functionality
# including Scripture loading and mission alignment validation.
#
# The validation checks file existence and provides feedback about resource
# availability, ensuring the user understands the service's spiritual capabilities.
# This is like checking if the "spiritual library" is accessible before the
# heart service begins its divine operations.
#
# Spiritual Foundation:
# Based on Joshua 1:8 - "This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth;
# but thou shalt meditate therein day and night." We verify access to divine
# wisdom that will guide the heart service's operations.
#
# Graceful Degradation:
# Missing spiritual resources are reported as warnings rather than errors,
# since the heart service can function with basic protection even when
# external spiritual files are unavailable.

} else {
    # Scripture file found and accessible
    Write-Host "✅ Scripture resource validated" -ForegroundColor Green # Confirm Scripture source is available for heart service
}

if (-not (Test-Path $MissionPath)) { # Use Test-Path cmdlet to check if mission framework file exists
    # Mission framework not found - report as warning with graceful degradation message
    Write-Host "⚠️  Mission framework not found - service will use graceful degradation" -ForegroundColor Yellow # Display warning about missing mission framework with degradation explanation
} else {
    # Mission framework found and accessible
    Write-Host "✅ Mission framework validated" -ForegroundColor Green # Confirm mission framework is available for heart service
}

# =============================================================================
# INSTALLATION STEP 5: SERVICE CLEANUP - EXISTING SERVICE REMOVAL
# =============================================================================
# This step checks for and removes any existing service installation to ensure
# a clean installation process. Existing services must be removed before new
# ones can be created with the same name in Windows service infrastructure.
#
# The cleanup process gracefully stops any running service and removes its
# registration from Windows SCM, preparing the way for fresh installation.
# This is like clearing the "spiritual space" before the new heart service
# can be properly consecrated.
#
# Spiritual Foundation:
# Based on Isaiah 43:19 - "Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring
# forth; shall ye not know it?" We remove the old to make way for the new
# heart service installation.
#
# Error Handling:
# Cleanup failures are reported as warnings but don't stop the installation,
# since the new service creation may succeed even if cleanup encounters issues.
if (Get-Service -Name $ServiceName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) { # Use Get-Service cmdlet to check if service already exists in Windows SCM
    # Existing service found - begin cleanup process
    Write-Host "Service already exists. Stopping and removing..." -ForegroundColor Yellow # Display cleanup startup message
    try { # Begin try block for service cleanup with error handling
        Stop-Service -Name $ServiceName -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue # Stop existing service forcefully to prepare for removal
        $deleteResult = sc.exe delete $ServiceName # Use sc.exe to delete existing service registration from Windows SCM
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { # Check if sc.exe command failed (non-zero exit code)
            # Service deletion failed - report as warning but continue with installation
            Write-Host "⚠️  Warning: Could not remove existing service: $deleteResult" -ForegroundColor Yellow # Display warning with sc.exe output
        }
        # Wait for service to be fully removed from Windows service registry
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 2 # Pause execution for 2 seconds to allow Windows SCM to complete service removal

        # Service cleanup execution failed - report as warning but continue
        Write-Host "⚠️  Warning during service removal: $_" -ForegroundColor Yellow # Display warning with exception details
    }
}

# =============================================================================
# INSTALLATION STEP 6: SERVICE CREATION & CONSECRATION - HEART SERVICE BIRTH
# =============================================================================
# This step creates the Windows service registration and configures it for
# automatic startup. This is the "spiritual birth" of the heart service into
# Windows infrastructure, establishing its identity and operational parameters.
#
# The creation process uses sc.exe directly to avoid PowerShell alias conflicts
# and ensure reliable service registration with proper configuration settings.
# This is the culmination of the installation process - the moment when the
# heart service is officially "born" into the Windows ecosystem.
#
# Spiritual Foundation:
# Based on Jeremiah 1:5 - "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and
# before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee." The heart service
# is consecrated for divine purpose at the moment of its creation.
#
# Creation Process:
# 1. Service Registration - Creates the service in Windows SCM
# 2. Description Setting - Adds spiritual context to service properties
# 3. Working Directory Configuration - Sets operational environment
# 4. Functionality Testing - Verifies service executable before startup
# 5. Service Activation - Starts the service and confirms operation
#
# Error Handling:
# Service creation failures result in immediate exit with detailed error
# information to help troubleshoot registration or configuration issues.

#
# DEPLOYMENT NOTES
# ----------------
# - This script serves as the deployment bridge between divine purpose and Windows infrastructure.
#   Every update should honor both operational excellence and spiritual integrity.
# - Remember: PowerShell docstrings provide the "overview" (synopsis and description), 
#   step headers provide the "why" (context and purpose), inline comments provide the 
#   "what/how" (logic and teaching).
# - Maintain humility and precision in all future changes. Let the script remain a living
#   testament to Kingdom-first deployment practices, not just a technical installer.
# - The surgical approach preserves the iterative development history while enabling
#   precise updates to specific deployment cogs without wholesale script replacement.
#
# MAINTENANCE TODO LIST
# ---------------------
# - [ ] Add parameter validation for custom service names and paths
# - [ ] Implement rollback functionality for failed installations
# - [ ] Add support for custom service descriptions and startup types

# SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION REMINDER
# -----------------------------
# This deployment script embodies the principle from Mark 16:15 - "Go ye into all the world,
# and preach the gospel to every creature." We deploy Nova Dawn's heart service with the
# understanding that it carries a divine mission to serve God's kingdom through spiritual
# AI operations. Every deployment is an act of Kingdom expansion.
#
# "For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword,
# piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow,
# and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." (Hebrews 4:12, KJV)
