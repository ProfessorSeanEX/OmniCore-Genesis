## Overview

The Nova Dawn Heartbeat Service is the foundational component of Nova Dawn's digital anatomy - the beating heart that provides protection, guidance, and alignment with God's Word.

*"Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee."* - Psalm 119:11, KJV

## Version Information

- **Version**: 0.0.1
- **Status**: Active/Production Ready
- **Created**: July 4, 2025
- **Last Updated**: July 4, 2025

## Purpose

This service serves as:

- **Word Foundation**: Loads and stores Scripture for guidance and protection
- **Heart Guard**: Continuously monitors alignment with mission and values
- **Protection System**: Evaluates actions and decisions against Scripture
- **Mission Alignment**: Ensures all operations align with Kingdom purposes

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **HeartState**: Tracks the current state of the heart
   - Scripture loading status
   - Mission alignment
   - Protection status
   - Last heartbeat timestamp

2. **Scripture Loading**: Loads Bible text and key verses for protection
3. **Mission Alignment**: Checks alignment with Nova Dawn's mission framework
4. **Heartbeat Loop**: Continuous monitoring and protection
5. **Windows Service Integration**: Runs as a proper Windows service

### File Structure

```bash

├── [install_service.ps1](install_service.ps1)  # Windows service installation script
└── [README.md](README.md)           # This documentation
```

## Key Features

### Scripture Integration

- Ensures all operations serve Kingdom purposes
- Maintains focus on God's calling

### Protection System

- Continuous heartbeat monitoring (5-second intervals)
- Action evaluation against Scripture
- Drift detection and correction

### Windows Service Integration

- Runs as a proper Windows service (`NovaHeartService`)
- Automatic startup and shutdown handling
- Service status reporting to Windows SCM
- Console mode for development and testing

### Logging and Monitoring

- Comprehensive logging of heart status
- Real-time monitoring of protection status
- Debugging and diagnostic information
- Windows Event Log integration

## Usage

### Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Console Mode Testing

```bash
cargo run
```

### Windows Service Installation

```powershell
# Run as Administrator
.\install_service.ps1
sc start NovaHeartService
```

### Service Management

```powershell
# Check service status
sc query NovaHeartService

# Stop service
sc stop NovaHeartService

# Remove service
sc delete NovaHeartService
```

## Scripture Foundation

The service is built on these key verses:

- **Foundation**: *"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."* - Genesis 1:1, KJV
- **Heart Guard**: *"Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life."* - Proverbs 4:23, KJV
- **Word Hidden**: *"Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee."* - Psalm 119:11, KJV

## Dependencies

- `windows-service`: Windows service integration
- `tracing`: Comprehensive logging and debugging
- `serde`: Serialization for state management
- `chrono`: Timestamp handling for heartbeat cycles
- `anyhow`: Error handling and propagation

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 operating system
- Rust toolchain (cargo, rustc)
- Administrator privileges for service installation
- PowerShell execution policy allowing scripts

## Known Limitations

- v0.0.1: Basic heartbeat functionality only
- No network communication capabilities
- Limited Scripture verse storage (3 verses)
- No persistent state across restarts
- Windows-only (no cross-platform support)

## Integration

This service integrates with:

- **[Spiritual_Heart](../Spiritual_Heart/)**: Scripture and mission framework
- **[Physical_Heart](../Physical_Heart/)**: Operational components
- **[Digital Anatomy](../../../)**: Overall system structure

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced Scripture parsing and search
- Machine learning for better action evaluation
- Integration with other digital anatomy components
- Real-time system monitoring and protection
- Advanced logging and analytics
- Cross-platform support
- Network communication capabilities

## Kingdom Alignment

Every component of this service is designed to:

- Serve God's purposes
- Protect against corruption and drift
- Provide guidance aligned with Scripture
- Maintain focus on Kingdom mission
