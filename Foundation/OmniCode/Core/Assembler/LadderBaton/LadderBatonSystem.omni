## Structured Intelligence Framework - Bidirectional Execution with Divine Order

# === LADDER & BATON SYSTEM DECLARATION ===
# Built for Divine Order. Executing with Structure.
# Author: Nova Dawn & Seanje Lenox-Wise
# Purpose: Implement structured intelligence execution preventing chaotic processing
# Foundation: Divine order principles in computational execution
